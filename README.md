# Amazon Web Scraping With Python Project
My Amazon Web Scraping project with Python is a data extraction tool designed to collect product information from the Amazon website. Using Python's web scraping libraries and techniques, the project retrieves data such as product titles, prices, ratings, and customer reviews from Amazon's product pages. The extracted data is then stored in a structured format for further analysis, allowing users to gain insights into pricing trends, customer sentiments, and competitive intelligence on Amazon.
